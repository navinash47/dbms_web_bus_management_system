**BUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**


We aim to get the Indian Bus Service for passengers.
Examples of queries that can be supported for this database are:
- Register new Bus stand
- Adding Bus to Database
- Add new routes to Bus
- Create tickets for passengers
- Search tickets with PNR ENQUIRY
- Add Admin to the Database for handling the Bus Management system

We can use this DBMS for any bus management system like ., Red bus etc.,
There will be an admin page from where the data in the database will be handled
or added by the admins.
